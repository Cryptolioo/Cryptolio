# Welcome to Cryptolio!

Cryptolio is a Cryptocurrency portfolio tracker and position size calculator. We were founded in December of 2021, so are currently in beta stage. We hope to support many more cryptocurrencies on the platform in 2021 and have plans to add numerous new features which will enhance the users experience. 

## Cryptolio
When you enter our site, you will be brought to the main page. From here you can choose to login to your account or register to our platform if you wish to start tracking your crypto portfolio. All users are able to use our position size calculator or contact us whether you have an account with our platform or not.

## Logging in

## Adding Crypto to Portfolio
To add a cryptocurrency to the portfolio, click the plus icon at the bottom of the page. Once clicked you will be brought to a new page where you can add your desired cryptocurrency. There are two input boxes, one for the ticker (BTC, ETH, e.t.c) and also your holdings (how much of the cryptocurrency you hold). All the other details such as the logo, fullname and price will be added to the cryptocurrencies data in the database once successfully created.

If you add a cryptocurrency that already exists, the holdings on the original cryptocurrency will be updated.

If a ticker you entered is not currently supported, you will be notified. You can email our support team at support@cryptolog.com and we will add your desired cryptocurrency to our database.

## Editing Crypto
To edit a cryptocurrency, just click the pencil icon to the right hand side of the cryptocurrency you wish to edit. Once clicked you will be brought to a new page where you can edit your holdings. The ticker is not editable. Once a cryptocurrency has been successfully edited you will be redirected back to the portfolio page where your changes will be visible.

## Deleting Crypto
To delete a cryptocurrency, just click the trashcan icon to the right hand side of the cryptocurrency you wish to delete. After this icon has been clicked the cryptocurrency will be removed from your portfolio immediately.
