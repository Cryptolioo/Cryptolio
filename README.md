# Welcome to Cryptolio!

Cryptolio is a Cryptocurrency portfolio tracker and position size calculator. We were founded in January of 2021, so are currently in beta stage.

## Adding Crypto to Portfolio
To add a cryptocurrency to your portfolio, click the plus icon at the bottom of the page. Once clicked a popup will appear where you can add your desired cryptocurrency. There are two input boxes, one for the ticker (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc) and also your holdings (how much of the cryptocurrency you hold). All the other details such as the logo, fullname and price will be added to the cryptocurrencies data in the database once successfully created.

If you add a cryptocurrency that already exists, the holdings on the original cryptocurrency will be updated.

If a ticker you entered is not currently supported, you will be notified. You can create a support query in our contact us page to request a particular cryptocurrency to be added or you can email our support team at support@cryptolioo.com and we will add your desired cryptocurrency to our database.

## Editing Crypto
To edit a cryptocurrency, just click the pencil icon to the right hand side of the cryptocurrency you wish to edit. Once clicked a popup will appear where you can edit your holdings. Once a cryptocurrency has been successfully edited the popup will close and you will be back on the portfolio page.

## Deleting Crypto
To delete a cryptocurrency, just click the trashcan icon to the right hand side of the cryptocurrency you wish to delete. After this icon has been clicked the cryptocurrency will be removed from your portfolio immediately.

## Position Size Calculator
To use the position size calculator, enter  your account size, and the percentage of your account you wish to risk along with your entry and stop-loss. Our position sizing calculator will suggest position sizes based on the information you provide.__
For example: If you have a $1000 account and wish to risk 1% of your account on an Ethereum trade where your entry price is $2500 and your stop-loss is at $2000. The maximum amount of Ethereum you can buy is 0.02 ETH. This means that if you bought at $2500 and price went to $2000 which hit your stop-loss, you would have lost $10 which is 1% of your account overall.

## Logout
Once you are logged in and wish to logout, you can simply select the logout option from the dropdown menu which will log you out.
